## Installing Roach as a Standalone Package

Most project will want to install one of Roach’s framework specific adapters to help cut down on the configuration and boilerplate necessary. If you want to use Roach as a standalone package, however, you can do so by installing the core package via `composer`.

```bash
composer require roach-php/core
```

That’s all there is to it.
